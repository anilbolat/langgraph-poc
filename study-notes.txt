#### ELEMENETS ######################
state
- application memory.

nodes
-individual functions.

graph
- how different tasks (nodes) are connected and executed.

edge
- connection between nodes.

conditional edge
- specialized connections.

start node
- workflow begins.
- doesn't perform any operation.

end node

tools
- specialized functions.
e.g. fetching data from an API.

ToolNode
- special node to run a tool.

StateGraph
- a class used to build and compile the graph structure.

runnable
- executable component to perform a specific task in workflow.

messages
- human - input from user
- system - context to the model, instructions.
- ai - response from model.
- function - result of a function call.
- tool - result of a tool usage.

add_messages ( from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages)
--- Reducer function
    - Rule that controls how updates from nodes are combined with the existing state.
    - Tells us how to merge new data into the current state.

    - Without a reducer, updates would have replaced the existing value entirely!


############ types

Annotated
- provides additional context without affecting the type itself.
- email = Annotated[str, "this has to be a valid email format!]


Sequence
- to automatically handle the state updates for sequences such as by adding new messgaes to a chat history.
